# Attrition-Churn-prediction-project:
* Churn/Attrition is defined in business terms as ‘when a client cancels a subscription to a service they have been using.’
* A common example is people cancelling Spotify/Netflix subscriptions.
* So, Churn Prediction is essentially predicting which clients are most likely to cancel a subscription i.e ‘leave a company’ based on their usage of the service.
* Acquiring new customers is often arduous and costlier than retaining old ones. Hence, the insights gained from Churn Prediction helps them to focus more on the customers that are at a high risk of leaving.

### Dataset:
* It contains 20 features (gender, senior citizens,tenure,...)
* Target variable is binary categorical variable (churn/not)

### Data Preprocessing:
* EDA on the dataset
* Data Cleaning
* Encodings, dropping unnecessary features.

### Modelling using Logistic Regression & XGBoost:
* Logistic Regression performs better than XGBoost
* LR gives an accuracy of about 81%.
